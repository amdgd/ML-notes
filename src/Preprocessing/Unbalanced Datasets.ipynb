    "A data set is called imbalanced if it contains many more samples from one class than from the rest of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sets are unbalanced when at least one class is represented by only a small number of training examples (called the minority class) while other classes make up the majority. In this scenario, classifiers can have good accuracy on the majority class but very poor accuracy on the minority class(es) due to the influence that the larger majority class has on traditional training criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common techniques to deal with unbalanced data include resizing training datasets, cost-sensitive classifier, and snowball method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, several methods have been proposed with good performance on unbalanced data. These approaches include modified SVMs, k nearest neighbor (kNN), neural networks, genetic programming, rough set based algorithms, probabilistic decision tree and learning methods. "
