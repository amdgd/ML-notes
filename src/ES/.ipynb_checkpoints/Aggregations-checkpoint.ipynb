    "## Bucket Aggregations\n",
    "A bucket is simply a collection of documents that meet certain criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An employee would land in either the male or female bucket.\n",
    "- The city of Albany would land in the New York state bucket.\n",
    "- The date 2014-10-28 would land within the October bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "As aggregations are executed, the values inside each document are evaluated to determine whether they match a bucketâ€™s criteria. If they match, the document is placed inside the bucket and the aggregation continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bucket aggregations donâ€™t calculate metrics over fields like the metrics aggregations do, but instead, they create buckets of documents. Each bucket is associated with a criterion (depending on the aggregation type) which determines whether or not a document in the current context \"falls\" into it. In other words, the buckets effectively define document sets. In addition to the buckets themselves, the bucket aggregations also compute and return the number of documents that \"fell into\" each bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bucket aggregations, as opposed to metrics aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub-aggregations will be aggregated for the buckets created by their \"parent\" bucket aggregation."

    "## Combining Metrics and Buckets\n",
    "An aggregation is a combination of buckets and metrics. An aggregation may have a single bucket, or a single metric, or one of each. It may even have multiple buckets nested inside other buckets. For example, we can partition documents by which country they belong to (a bucket), and then calculate the average salary per country (a metric).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because buckets can be nested, we can derive a much more complex aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition documents by country (bucket).\n",
    "Then partition each country bucket by gender (bucket).\n",
    "Then partition each gender bucket by age ranges (bucket).\n",
    "Finally, calculate the average salary for each age range (metric)\n",
    "This will give you the average salary per <country, gender, age> combination. All in one request and with one pass over the data!"
