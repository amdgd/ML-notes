    "\n",
    "- Since the continuous random variable is defined over a continuous range of values (called the domain of the variable), the graph of the density function will also be continuous over that range.\n",

    "A sequence of Bernoulli trials satisfies the following assumptions:\n",
    "- Each trial has two possible outcomes, in the language of reliability called success and failure.\n",
    "- The trials are independent. Intuitively, the outcome of one trial has no influence over the outcome of another trial.\n",
    "- On each trial, the probability of success is p and the probability of failure is (1 − p) where p ∈ [0,1] is the success parameter of the process."

    "For a discrete random variable, a probability distribution contains the probability of each possible outcome. However, for a continuous random variable, the probability of any one outcome is zero (if you specify it to enough decimal places). A probability density function is a formula that can be used to compute probabilities of a range of outcomes for a continuous random variable. The sum of all densities is always 1.0 and the value of the function is always greater or equal to zero."
