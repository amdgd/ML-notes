    "#### 1. anecdotal evidence:\n",
    "Evidence,  often  personal,  that  is  collected  casually rather than by a well-designed study.\n",
    "####  2. population:\n",
    "A group we are interested in studying, often a group of people, but the term is also used for animals, vegetables and minerals\n",
    "####  3. cross-sectional study:\n",
    "A  study  that  collects  data  about  a  population  at  a particular point in time.\n",
    "####  4. cycle: \n",
    "In a repeated cross-sectional study, each repetition of the study is called a cycle.\n",
    "####  5. longitudinal study: A study that follows a population over time,\n",
    "collecting data from the same group repeatedly.\n",
    "####  6. record: \n",
    "In a dataset, a collection of information about a single person or other subject.\n",
    "####  7. sample: \n",
    "The subset of a population used to collect data.\n",
    "####  8. representative: \n",
    "A sample is representative if every member of the population has the same chance of being in the sample.\n",
    "####  9. effect size:\n",
    "is a summary statistic intended to describe the size of an effect. For example, to describe the difference between two groups, one obvious choice is the difference in the means\n",
    "####  10. clinically significant\n",
    "A result, like a difference between groups, that is relevant in practice.\n",
    "####  11. normal distribution / Gaussian distribution: \n",
    "An idealization of a bell-shaped distribution; also known as a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "<img src=\"http://web.calstatela.edu/curvebank/gaussdist/normal.jpg\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  12. uniform distribution: \n",
    "A distribution in which all values have the same frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.epixanalytics.com/modelassist/CrystalBall/images/9/image524.gif\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  13. Probability mass function (PMF): \n",
    "a representation of a distribution as a function that maps from values to probabilities.\n",
    "####  14. probability: \n",
    "A frequency expressed as a fraction of the sample size.\n",
    "####  15. normalization: \n",
    "The process of dividing a frequency by a sample size to get a probability\n",
    "percentile rank: The percentage of values in a distribution that are less\n",
    "than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "####  16. percentile: \n",
    "The value associated with a given percentile rank.\n",
    "####  17. cumulative distribution function (CDF): \n",
    "A function that maps from values to their cumulative probabilities. CDF(x) is the fraction of the sample less than or equal to x. It's equivalent to PercentileRank, except that the result is a probability in the range 0 to 1\n",
    "####  18. inverse CDF: \n",
    "A function that maps from a cumulative probability, p,to the corresponding value\n",
    "#### 19. Discrete Distribution\n",
    "A statistical distribution whose variables can take on only discrete values. \n",
    "- PMF is a type of discrete distribution, as a PMF represents the probabilities for a discrete set of values.\n",
    "- A discrete distribution is appropriate when the variable can only take on a fixed number of values. \n",
    "- E.g. if you roll a normal die, you can get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. You cannot get 1.2 or 0.1. If it is a fair die, the probability distribution will be \n",
    "1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www2.cedarcrest.edu/academic/bio/hale/biostat/session10links/probgraph.jpg\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 19. Continuous Distribution\n",
    "A continuous distribution is appropriate when the variable can take on (at least in theory) an infinite number of values. You can weigh 150.2311 kgs or 150.1012 kgs. \n",
    "- Continuous distributions cannot be written so neatly as the uniform discrete distribution,\n",
    "- As a result, a continuous probability distribution cannot be expressed in tabular form.\n",
    "- Instead, an equation or formula is used to describe a continuous probability distribution.\n",
    "<img src=\"http://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/statsreview/files/2013/06/family.jpeg\" width=200>\n",

    "#### Probability Density Function (pdf)\n",
    "Most often, the equation used to describe a continuous probability distribution is called a probability density function . Sometimes, it is referred to as a density function, a PDF, or a pdf. For a continuous probability distribution, the density function has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the continuous random variable is defined over a continuous range of values (called the domain of the variable), the graph of the density function will also be continuous over that range.\n",
    "- The area bounded by the curve of the density function and the x-axis is equal to 1, when computed over the domain of the variable.\n",
    "- The probability that a random variable assumes a value between a and b is equal to the area under the density function bounded by a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 20. empirical distributions\n",
    "Are based on empirical observations, which are necessarily finite samples.\n",
    "#### 21. analytics distributions\n",
    "The alternative to emprical distribution is an analytic distribution, which is characterized by a CDF that is a mathematical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 22. binomial distribution\n",
    "The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution. It describes the outcome of n independent trials in an experiment. Each trial is assumed to have only two outcomes, either success or failure.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.optiontradingtips.com/images/binomial-distribution.jpg\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the difference between Binomial and Normal Distributions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution whereas the normal distribution is a continuous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 23. Bernoulli trials\n",
    "A sequence of Bernoulli trials satisfies the following assumptions:\n",
    "- Each trial has two possible outcomes, in the language of reliability called success and failure.\n",
    "- The trials are independent. Intuitively, the outcome of one trial has no influence over the outcome of another trial.\n",
    "- On each trial, the probability of success is p and the probability of failure is (1 − p) where p ∈ [0,1] is the success parameter of the process."
