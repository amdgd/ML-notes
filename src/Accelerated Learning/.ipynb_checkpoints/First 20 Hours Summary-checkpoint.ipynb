    "\n",
    "The core idea is that one can learn almost any skills sufficiently quickly with proper strategy, focus and technique. \n",
    "The most esential thing about skill learning is to develop temporary obsession about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### To learn a skill \n",
    "- Deconstruct a skill into smallest sub-skills\n",
    "- Learn enough about each sub-skills to practice and self correct during practice\n",
    "- Remove physical, mental and emotional barriers\n",
    "- Practice the most important sub-skills for atleast 20 hours\n"

    "## Phases of Skill Acquistion\n",
    "\n",
    "Skill acquisition happens in these three stages\n",
    "1. **Cognitive** - Reasearching, thinking and understanding about the skill. Breaking the skills into manageable parts.\n",
    "2. **Associative** - Practising, getting feedback and adjusting based on feedback\n",
    "3. **Autonomus** - Effectively performing the skill with little thinking or paying unnecessary attention to it.  \n"

    "## Major principles\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 1. Choose a lovable project\n",
    "The more excited one is about the skill, the faster he will acquire it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Focus your energy on one skill at a time\n",
    "Pick one and only one skill to learn at a time. Give it your concentrated time and focus, amd place all other skills on a temporary hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Define your target performance level\n",
    "Define what's good enough is for you or describe on what level would you be able to perform the skill you are acquiring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Deconstruct the skill into sub-skills\n",
    "Break down the skills into the smallest possible sub-skills and than focus on the critical sub-skills first\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Obtain critical tools\n",
    "First identify all the critical tools and equipments you need to learn that skill and than get them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Eliminate barriers to practice\n",
    "YOu have to eliminate all barries that can stop your from focussed and concentrated efforts - physical, mental and emotional.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Make dedicated time to practice\n",
    "Set up a dedicated time to practice. Since early parts of a skill acquiistion are the hardest - they are the time you are most prone to abandon the skill. Precommitting to 20 hours will make it easier to persist.\n",
